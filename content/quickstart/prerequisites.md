For this exercise, youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster. If you need help setting one up, check out our [cheat sheet](k8s_setup.md). This guide assumes a single node cluster.

The operator uses Helm to create and deploy the necessary resources and then run the operator in a Kubernetes cluster. For Helm installation and usage information, see [Install Helm and Tiller](install.md#install-helm-and-tiller).

You should clone this repository to your local machine so that you have access to the
various sample files mentioned throughout this guide:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator
```
