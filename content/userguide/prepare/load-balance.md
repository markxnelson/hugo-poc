### Load balancing with an Ingress controller or a web server

You can choose a load balancer provider for your WebLogic domains running in a Kubernetes cluster.
Please refer to the [WebLogic Operator Load Balancer Samples](../kubernetes/samples/charts/README.md)
for information about the current capabilities and setup instructions for each of the supported load balancers.
